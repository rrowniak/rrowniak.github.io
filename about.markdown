Welcome to my software engineering blog! Here, I aim to share my knowledge and practical experiences with the community, including measurements and experiments related to programming and software development. While my primary programming language is C++, I also cover other languages such as C, Python, and Java. In addition to programming, I also delve into broader topics in the field of software engineering.

On my blog, you will find articles in both English and Polish. Some posts may be published in one language, while others may be available in both. If you feel that a particular post would benefit from being translated, please let me know. I hope you find my content helpful and informative!

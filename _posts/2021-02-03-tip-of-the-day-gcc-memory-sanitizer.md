Today I‚Äôm going to show you how effectively solve painful issues related to memory corruption occurrences.

Let‚Äôs start from the example. Consider the following code:

```
<pre class="wp-block-code">```cpp
#include <iostream>

int array[2];
int table[2];

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{   
    array[2] = 11;

    if (table[0] == 0) {
        std::cout << "Obvious!" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Not really... Something is wrong" << std::endl;
        std::cout << table[0] << " vs " << array[2] << std::endl;
    }

    return array[0];
}
```
```

And corresponding makefile:

```
<pre class="wp-block-code">```bash
CPPFLAGS = -g -Wall
LDFLAGS = -g
LDLIBS = -lm -ldl

test: test.o
    g++ $(LDFLAGS) -o test test.o $(LDLIBS)

test.o: test.cpp
    g++ $(CPPFLAGS) -c test.cpp

clean:
    @rm test test.o
```
```

Let‚Äôs build &amp; execute the program:

```
<pre class="wp-block-code">```bash
$ make
 g++ -g -Wall -c test.cpp
 g++ -g -o test test.o -lm -ldl
$ ./test 
 Not really‚Ä¶ Something is wrong
 11 vs 11
```
```

The issue is visible in the source without using any fancy tool. But if you have hundreds of thousands of lines of code, the problem isn‚Äôt such trivial. Moreover, it may not manifest all the time but just from time to time and it doesn‚Äôt have to be a crash ‚Äì sometimes it‚Äôs just a weird program behavior like the above example.

Can we do anything around that? Yes ‚Äì gcc built-in address sanitizer. That feature adds additional instrumentation to our code and will perform monitoring in the runtime like checking whether our code access only allocated memory, stack overflows, and many more.

In order to enable the address sanitizer let‚Äôs modify slightly our makefile:

```
<pre class="wp-block-code">```bash
CPPFLAGS = -g -Wall
LDFLAGS = -g
LDLIBS = -lm -ldl

test: test.o
    g++ $(LDFLAGS) -o test test.o $(LDLIBS)

test.o: test.cpp
    g++ $(CPPFLAGS) -c test.cpp

asan: CPPFLAGS += -fsanitize=address
asan: LDLIBS += -lasan
asan: test

clean:
    @rm test test.o
```
```

And build ‚Äì this time using non-default target:

```
<pre class="wp-block-code">```bash
$ make clean
$ make asan
 g++ -g -Wall -fsanitize=address -c test.cpp
 g++ -g -o test test.o -lm -ldl -lasan
```
```

Now the most interesting part ‚Äì let‚Äôs execute our program:

```
<pre class="wp-block-code">```bash
$ ./test

At first glance the output looks a bit scary. But there is everything that you need to solve the puzzle. Especially that comment: ‚Äû*AddressSanitizer: **global-buffer-overflow on address** (‚Ä¶) **WRITE of size 4** in main /home/**test.cpp:8** (‚Ä¶)*‚Äù ‚Äì that‚Äôs all what you really need.

That‚Äôs it, see you next time üôÇ

The main purpose of this blog is to share some knowledge, practical experiments, measurements related to software engineering. Leading programming language is C++ but not limited to. You may come across C, Python, Java and possibly more. Also there will be posted articles which go further than programming languages.

You can find here articles written in English and Polish as well. Some of them may be released in Polish, some in English, some in both languages. If you believe that a particular post should be translated, just let me know.

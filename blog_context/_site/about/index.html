    <p>Welcome to my software engineering blog! Here, I aim to share my knowledge and practical experiences with the community, including measurements and experiments related to programming and software development. While my primary programming language is C++, I also cover other languages such as C, Python, and Java. In addition to programming, I also delve into broader topics in the field of software engineering.</p>

<p>On my blog, you will find articles in both English and Polish. Some posts may be published in one language, while others may be available in both. If you feel that a particular post would benefit from being translated, please let me know. I hope you find my content helpful and informative!</p>
